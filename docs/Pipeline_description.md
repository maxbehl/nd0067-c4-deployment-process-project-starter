## Pipeline steps

### Build

In the build phase CicrleCi spins up an environment with Node.js, checks out the Code in GitHub, installs all front-/backend dependencies, lints the frontend code and builds the front-/backend.

### Hold

The Hold steps is just needed because a approval was added to the pipeline. After a manual approval was given the next step starts.
